We'll explore the APIs that wrap the LLMs, tool/function calling, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and more. We'll then dive into the various tools available for developers to use. Come with questions and (hopefully) leave with answers!\n\nPizza and soft drinks will be provided at the event.",

Outages never seem to happen at a convenient time\u2014they're always at 2 a.m., never at 1 p.m. when you're in the right mind to fix them. And when you're fast asleep (maybe!), database failures or stuck CRON jobs are the last thing on your mind.\n\nThe best protection against overnight outages is being prolific in battle-hardening your app. In this talk, we'll discuss traits of stable production applications so you and your team can rest well at night.\n\nTopics include logging and telemetry, designing for redundancy, optimizing environments, enabling rapid deployments, testing, and more! For developers or SREs alike, let's talk about proven techniques that'll allow you to sleep soundly at night.\n\nPizza and soft drinks will be provided at the event.",
