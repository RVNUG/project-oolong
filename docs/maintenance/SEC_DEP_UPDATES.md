## Implementation Status

The following updates have been applied:

1. ✅ Updated `vite-plugin-imagemin` to version 0.4.0 
2. ✅ Updated `imagemin-gifsicle` to version 5.2.0
3. ✅ Updated `imagemin-mozjpeg` to version 7.0.0
4. ✅ Updated `imagemin-pngquant` to version 5.0.1

These updates have partially addressed the security issues, but many vulnerabilities remain due to the deep dependency tree of the image optimization packages. However, we've verified that:

1. ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
2. ✅ `npm run preview` shows a fully functional website

## Remaining Issues

Many of the remaining vulnerabilities stem from deeply nested dependencies in the image optimization ecosystem. A complete fix might require:

1. Considering alternative image optimization packages or approaches
2. Possibly implementing a custom build step for image optimization outside the main dependency tree
3. Evaluating if image optimization can be handled at build time using a separate tool chain
