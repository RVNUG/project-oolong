## Recommended Fixes

Most of these vulnerabilities are related to image optimization dependencies. The main recommended fixes are:

1. Update `vite-plugin-imagemin` to version 0.4.0 or newer
2. Update `imagemin-gifsicle` to version 5.2.0 or newer
3. Update `imagemin-mozjpeg` to version 7.0.0 or newer
4. Update `imagemin-pngquant` to version 5.0.1 or newer

## Action Plan

1. Test updates to ensure they don't break existing functionality
2. Create a dedicated branch for security updates
3. Apply updates and run comprehensive tests
4. Document any breaking changes and necessary adjustments

### Changes Made:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Removed | Removed `vite-plugin-imagemin` and all associated imagemin plugins |
| ✅ Removed | Removed `imagemin-gifsicle`, `imagemin-mozjpeg`, `imagemin-pngquant`, `imagemin-svgo` |
| ✅ Added | Added `vite-plugin-image-optimizer` (version 1.1.8) |
| ✅ Added | Added `sharp` (version 0.33.3) for modern image processing |
| ✅ Added | Added `svgo` (version 3.3.0) for SVG optimization |
| ✅ Updated | Updated Vite configuration to use the new image optimizer |

### Results:

```
npm audit
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Verification Steps Completed:

1. ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
2. ✅ `npm run preview` shows a fully functional website
3. ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected in npm audit

## Benefits of the New Approach

The new image optimization solution provides several advantages:

1. **Security**: Eliminates all the vulnerabilities present in the previous solution
2. **Performance**: Uses modern Sharp.js library which is much faster and more reliable
3. **Maintainability**: Simpler dependency structure with fewer dependencies
4. **Future-proof**: Active development and maintenance of the new dependencies
