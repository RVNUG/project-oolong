# Security Dependency Updates

This document tracks security vulnerabilities identified in our dependencies, their severity, and resolution status.

## Security Vulnerability Resolution

All security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved by replacing the problematic image optimization dependencies with a modern, secure alternative.

### Changes Made:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Removed | Removed `vite-plugin-imagemin` and all associated imagemin plugins |
| ✅ Removed | Removed `imagemin-gifsicle`, `imagemin-mozjpeg`, `imagemin-pngquant`, `imagemin-svgo` |
| ✅ Added | Added `vite-plugin-image-optimizer` (version 1.1.8) |
| ✅ Added | Added `sharp` (version 0.33.3) for modern image processing |
| ✅ Added | Added `svgo` (version 3.3.0) for SVG optimization |
| ✅ Updated | Updated Vite configuration to use the new image optimizer |

### Results:

```
npm audit
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Verification Steps Completed:

1. ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
2. ✅ `npm run preview` shows a fully functional website
3. ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected in npm audit

## Benefits of the New Approach

The new image optimization solution provides several advantages:

1. **Security**: Eliminates all the vulnerabilities present in the previous solution
2. **Performance**: Uses modern Sharp.js library which is much faster and more reliable
3. **Maintainability**: Simpler dependency structure with fewer dependencies
4. **Future-proof**: Active development and maintenance of the new dependencies
